## Mini Algorithm Exercise

"Cut and Paste"

### Objectives

- Create a function which takes a given array (`arr`) and an integer (`num`).
- Remove `num` amount of array elements from the beginning of `arr` and place them at the end.
- The output should be a new array.

> i.e.:
>
> input => `([1, 2, 5, "help", "wow", 3], 4)`
>
> output => `(["wow", 3, 1, 2, 5, "help"])`
